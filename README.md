# Monty Hall Problem Sim
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, based nominally on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Savant's response was that the contestant should switch to the other door.By the standard assumptions, the switching strategy has a ⁠
2
/
3
⁠ probability of winning the car, while the strategy of keeping the initial choice has only a ⁠
1
/
3
⁠ probability.

When the player first makes their choice, there is a ⁠
2
/
3
⁠ chance that the car is behind one of the doors not chosen. This probability does not change after the host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors. When the host provides information about the two unchosen doors (revealing that one of them does not have the car behind it), the ⁠
2
/
3
⁠ chance of the car being behind one of the unchosen doors rests on the unchosen and unrevealed door, as opposed to the ⁠
1
/
3
⁠ chance of the car being behind the door the contestant chose initially.
